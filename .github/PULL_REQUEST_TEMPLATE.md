<!--
Hi there! Thank you for your interest in the Azure IoT SDKs

Before you create a pull request though, please consider that each Azure IoT SDK now lives in its own repository:
- C:      https://github.com/azure/azure-iot-sdk-c
- .NET:   https://github.com/azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp
- Node:   https://github.com/azure/azure-iot-sdk-node
- Java:   https://github.com/azure/azure-iot-sdk-java
- Python: https://github.com/azure/azure-iot-sdk-python

We will not be accepting pull-requests for SDK code in this repository, and encourage you to clone the specific SDK repository and submit your PR there. 
Please remember that all code pull-requests must include tests and be submitted against the `develop` branch

Thank you again, we appreciate all feedback!
